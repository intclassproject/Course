docker ps

- If there are any stopped containers, they can be seen by adding the “-a” flag in this command
docker ps -a

- For logging into/accessing the container, one can use the exec command
docker exec <container-id>

- For stopping a running container, we use the “stop” command
docker stop <container-id>

- This command kills the container by stopping its execution immediately. The difference
between ‘docker kill’ and ‘docker stop’. ‘docker stop’ gives the container time to shutdown
gracefully, in situations when it is taking too much time for getting the container to stop, one
can opt to kill it

docker kill <container-id>

- To remove a stopped container from the system, we use the “rm” command
docker rm <container-id>

- To remove an image from the system we use the command “rmi”

docker rmi <image-id>
